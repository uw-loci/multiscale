Multiscale imaging at LOCI
===================

This library holds tools for multiscale imaging projects at the Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation.
It holds tools for image registration, for interfacing with several toolkits (e.g. CurveAlign), and other processing
tasks based on project.


## Motivation


## Submodules

This project includes several submodules.  Each submodule includes a "task_scripts" sub-submodule 
with scripts written for specific image analysis pipelines at LOCI

itk: Tools for supervised registration using the SimpleITK toolkit

microscopy: Interfacing with the LOCI program OpenScan and related microscopy files

polarimetry: Processing Mueller Matrix Polarimetry images

ultrasound: Reconstruction and processing of 3D US images from 2D slices
